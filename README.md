# The-Witch-s-House-unofficial-sequel

<p>This is a website that I made in 2013 as a final project. It's a site composed by 7 pages and made with html, a little css and js.</p>
<p>The js code is in the <script> inside the <head> of "Formulario.html"</p>
<p>Now I know that there isn't the right place to write it.</p>
